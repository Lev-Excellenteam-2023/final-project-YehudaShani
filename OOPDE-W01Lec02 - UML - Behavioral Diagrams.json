In OOP, the design and programming are centered around objects and their relationships, leading to the term \"object-oriented design and programming.\""},
{"slide_number": 4, "content": "Interaction diagrams are a family of diagrams that describe the dynamic behavior of an object-oriented system. They are a collection of messages exchanged between a set of objects in a particular context to achieve a specific goal. These diagrams are often used to model how a usage scenario is implemented using a sequence of messages between objects.\n\nObject-oriented design and programming (OOD/OOP) heavily rely on interaction diagrams to model and design the behavior of the system. This helps to break down the complex interactions into smaller, more manageable pieces, making it easier to understand and implement the design. Additionally, the use of interaction diagrams fosters good design practices, such as encapsulation, modularization, and separation of concerns."},
{"slide_number": 5, "content": "The topic is \"Interaction Diagrams\" and it discusses the purpose of using these diagrams, which is to model interactions between objects and to aid in understanding how a system works in practice (through use case scenarios). It also explains that by verifying that a use case scenario can be supported by existing classes, it is possible to identify areas of responsibility/actions and assign them to design and programming classes using object-oriented programming."},

{"slide_number": 7, "content": "This presentation covers several topics related to programming and design. \n\nThe first topic discusses a diagram that illustrates how objects interact with each other. This gives an overview of how different components of a system work together.\n\nThe second topic emphasizes the chronological order of messages exchanged between the objects. This helps in understanding the flow of information and how it contributes to the overall functioning of the system.\n\nThe third topic discusses the ability to model sequences of actions, control flow (conditions, loops), recursion, and parallelism. These are important concepts in programming that help developers create efficient and effective code.\n\nFinally, the presentation touches on the design and programming paradigm of object-oriented programming, which focuses on designing software around objects that have properties and methods. This approach allows for better organization, reusability, and easier maintenance of code."},

{"slide_number": 9, "content": "1. Object naming: Naming objects in your code is done using the syntax [instanceName]:[className] and should be done consistently. This helps to create a clear diagram of your code's classes and objects.\n\n2. Class naming: It is important to give classes meaningful and consistent names. This helps to make the code more readable and easier to understand.\n\n3. Omitting instance names: When there is only one instance of a particular object type in the diagram, the instance name can be omitted for simplicity.\n\n4. Life Line: In an object-oriented system design, the Life Line represents the lifespan of an object during the system's operation. It is an important concept in Object-Oriented Programming and is used to determine the life of an object in the system."},
{"slide_number": 10, "content": "1. Interaction messages between two objects are performed by sending a message from one object to another. This can be done through calling a function, sending events, or using Remote Procedure Call (RPC). These messages allow objects to communicate with each other and exchange information.\n\n2. In order for obj 2 to receive a message from obj 1, there must be a certain dependency or relationship between these two objects. This ensures that the message is sent and received correctly and that the objects are able to interact effectively.\n\n3. Object-oriented design and programming rely on the concept of encapsulation, meaning that objects are responsible for managing their own behavior and data. This approach allows for greater flexibility and modularity in programming, as objects can be reused in different contexts and easily modified as needed."},
{"slide_number": 11, "content": "These bullet points relate to the concept of message passing in object-oriented programming:\n\n- Messages (continued): Objects can send messages to each other, represented by an arrow between their lifelines. An object can also send a message to itself.\n- Processing time: The amount of time required for the recipient object to process the message is represented by an activation box.\n- Message tagging: A message is labeled with at least its name to identify its purpose.\n- Control information: A message can include control information such as variables, conditions, and loops.\n- Object-oriented design and programming: This approach emphasizes the use of objects with distinct behaviors and properties that interact with each other through messages."},
{"slide_number": 12, "content": "1. \"Returned values are represented by an arrow with a dashed line with a label indicating the returned value (optional) in case it is unclear, for example, getTotal(), the returned value is not included in the chart.\" This means that when creating diagrams or charts to illustrate a program or function, the arrow with a dashed line represents the returned value, and it may or may not have a label indicating what that value is. However, if the returned value is obvious or clear, it does not need to be included in the chart.\n\n2. \"A returned value should only be modeled if it needs to be referred to elsewhere, for example, as a parameter passed in another message.\" This means that you should only model a returned value if you need to refer to it in another function or part of the program.\n\n3. \"We prefer modeling returned values as part of the function invocation, for example, ok = isValid().\" This means that it is preferred to include the modeling of returned values as part of the function's implementation, rather than representing it separately on a chart. \n\n4. \"Object-oriented design and programming\" - This refers to a design and programming approach where the program is structured around objects and their interactions, allowing for greater modularity, flexibility, and scalability."},

{"slide_number": 31, "content": "1. Synchronous vs. Asynchronous: \n\nSynchronous programming means that everything happens in a sequence where one thing waits for the other. For example, you call a function and wait for it to finish before moving on to the next task. Asynchronous programming, on the other hand, means that different things can happen simultaneously, allowing you to start a task and move on to the next before the first task is complete.\n\n2. Object-oriented programming:\n\nObject-oriented programming focuses on creating objects from classes and using those objects to execute tasks. One concept of object-oriented programming is encapsulation, which helps keep code organized and reduces the chances of errors.\n\n3. Void:\n\nVoid is a data type often used in programming to indicate that the method or function does not return a value. In the case of the switch functions shown, the methods do not return any value but instead, turn a lamp on or off based on the state of the switch.\n\n4. SwitchSync() vs. SwitchAsync():\n\nThe two functions shown- SwitchSync() and SwitchAsync()- are different in that SwitchSync() is synchronous while SwitchAsync() is asynchronous. SwitchSync() turns on or off a lamp (represented as a boolean value ON) depending on the state of the switch, and then toggles the value of ON. On the other hand, SwitchAsync() uses an event, represented as evSwitch, to turn on or off the lamp, allowing other events to occur simultaneously."},

This helps to protect the data and ensures that the object behaves in a predictable way.\n\n3. Inheritance: Inheritance allows programmers to create a new class that is a modified version of an existing class, inheriting all of its properties and methods. This can help to reduce duplicated code and simplify the development process.\n\n4. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows different objects to be treated as if they are the same type, even if they have different behavior.
