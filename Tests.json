{"slide_number": 0, "content": "Tests, mocks and refactoring code are three important topics related to software development. \n\nTests are used to verify that the code works as intended. Tests can be written at different levels of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, and acceptance testing. Unit tests are automated tests that verify the behavior of individual code components. Integration tests verify that multiple components work together correctly. Acceptance tests test the entire application from a user's perspective.\n\nMocks are objects that simulate the behavior of real objects in tests. They allow developers to test a component in isolation without requiring the use of real dependencies. For example, if a component requires access to a database, a mock database can be used in tests instead of connecting to a real database. This makes tests more reliable and faster to run.\n\nRefactoring is the process of improving code without changing its functionality. This can involve making the code more readable, simplifying it, breaking it down into smaller components, and improving its performance. Refactoring is important because it makes code easier to maintain, reduces complexity, and can improve the overall quality of the code. By refactoring code, developers can improve its design, reduce bugs, and make it easier to test."},

{"slide_number": 5, "content": "Tests: In software development, tests are used to verify that the code behaves as expected. They help to detect errors and bugs in the code before it is deployed to production.\n\nWhen do we encounter them: Tests are encountered throughout the development process. They are typically written as soon as a new feature or functionality is added to the code, and they are also updated whenever code changes are made.\n\nAny new feature \u2013 we write tests: Whenever a new feature is developed, tests are written to ensure that the feature behaves as intended.\n\nAny code change \u2013 we make the tests pass: Whenever code changes are made, the tests are updated to reflect the changes. The tests are then run to ensure that the changes did not introduce any new bugs or errors.\n\nLocal example: The linked pull request in the Github repository for Flask shows an example of how tests are used in software development. The pull request contains changes to the tests for a specific function in the Flask library.\n\nAlmost every pull request contains test changes: It is common for pull requests in software development to include changes to tests, as developers aim to ensure that the code is tested and working as intended before it is merged into the main codebase."},
{"slide_number": 6, "content": "1. \"How much tests is too many?\" This topic relates to determining the ideal number of tests to be performed for software or code. The answer can vary according to the project, but in general, testing should be done until the critical functions are covered without redundancy or overlap.\n\n2. \"Unit Tests\" Unit Testing is a form of software testing that verifies individual components (or units) of a larger software system are working correctly. These tests are aimed at catching low-level issues within the codebase before they develop into major problems. In an ideal world, a single unit test has only one thing that can cause it to fail, and that one thing can only cause that test to fail.\n\n3. \"In an ideal world, a single unit test has only one thing that can cause it to fail, and that one thing can only cause that test to fail. Never the actual case\". This point explains that it is rare for a single fault to cause a unit test to fail. Usually, a unit test failure can be caused by multiple things.\n\n4. \"Testing each path of the code\" Testing each path of a code refers to executing the code through every possible sequence of branching and decisions. This is an important technique because it can ensure that the code behaves as expected in all possible scenarios, thus uncovering any potential issues that might arise in the future."},
{"slide_number": 7, "content": "Good test coverage is the measure of the effectiveness of software testing. It is the percentage of code which is being executed by the test suite. It is important because it helps users to understand which parts of the code are being tested and which are not. \n\nTest coverage is crucial to ensure that all aspects of the code are being tested. When you're dealing with big code, you're dealing with a large number of instructions and data. You can't test everything manually. It's important to have an automated testing suite that detects and reports errors. \n\nA good test coverage is typically considered to be 80% or higher. This means that the testing suite has covered at least 80% of the code and the code is being effectively tested. A good test coverage will also ensure that all the requirements are being met.\n\nTo achieve good test coverage, developers and testers should work together to write test cases that cover all the requirements and possible use cases. They should also regularly review and update the testing strategy to ensure that new features and changes to the code are being effectively tested."},

{"slide_number": 11, "content": "TDD is a software development methodology that places a strong emphasis on writing tests before writing the code. The process of TDD involves a cycle of writing a test, running it to check it fails, writing the code required to pass the test, running the test again and finally, refactoring the code to ensure that it maintains the test's ability to pass. This helps ensure that code is robust and reliable, while also improving its design and maintainability. Ultimately, TDD can lead to more efficient development and better quality software products."},
{"slide_number": 12, "content": "Assertions are statements written in the code that help developers check whether specific conditions are true at certain points in the program. Developers commonly use assertions for testing purposes to confirm that the code is running correctly by verifying that certain conditions or assumptions are valid during program execution. Essentially, assertions provide a means for developers to double-check that their code works as expected by programmatically verifying that the code behaves as intended."},
{"slide_number": 13, "content": "Mocks or mock objects are artificially created objects that mimic the behavior of real objects in your code. These are created using the `unittest.mock` module in Python.\n\nPatching is the process of replacing real objects in your code with mock objects during tests. This is done to isolate the code being tested and ensure that it is functioning correctly. The `patch` function in the `unittest.mock` module is used to patch objects.\n\nAssertions are statements in your test code that verify that certain conditions are met during tests.

{"slide_number": 17, "content": "Refactoring is a process of restructuring an existing codebase in order to improve its design and maintainability. The main purpose of refactoring is to make code more readable, modular, and maintainable, without changing its external behavior. Some of the common reasons for refactoring include eliminating code smells, improving performance, reducing coupling and redundancy, and enabling future changes and extensions.\n\nRefactoring can be done in several ways, such as renaming variables and functions, extracting methods and classes, replacing complex code with simpler alternatives, and eliminating duplicated code. Refactoring requires careful planning and testing, as it can introduce new bugs or affect the existing behavior of the code. Therefore, it is important to have a clear understanding of the codebase and its requirements before starting the refactoring process.\n\nRefactoring is an ongoing process, as codebases evolve and requirements change over time. It is essential for achieving maintainability and flexibility in software development, and can help teams to reduce technical debt and improve the efficiency and quality of their code. As such, refactoring plays an important role in modern software engineering practices, and is a key skill for developers and teams working on large and complex codebases."},
