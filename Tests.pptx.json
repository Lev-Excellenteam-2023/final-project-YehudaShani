{"slide_number": 19, "content": "Refactoring code is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior. Here are some key points that might be covered in a presentation on refactoring code:\n\n1. What is refactoring? As described above, refactoring involves making changes to the code in order to improve its structure, readability, and maintainability. This typically involves a series of small, incremental changes rather than a wholesale rewrite of the code.\n\n2. Why refactor code? There are many reasons why code might need to be refactored. Some common examples include improving performance, eliminating duplication, reducing complexity, and making the code easier to understand and modify.\n\n3. When to refactor code? Knowing when to refactor code is an important skill for developers. Factors that might indicate the need for refactoring include code smells (e.g. duplicated code or long methods), difficulty in extending or modifying the code, and a lack of automated tests.\n\n4. How to refactor code? Refactoring can be a complex process that requires careful planning and execution. Developers should start by creating a suite of automated tests to ensure that their changes don't introduce new bugs. They should then use techniques like renaming variables, extracting methods, and eliminating duplication to gradually improve the code's structure.\n\n5. Tools and techniques for refactoring code? There are many tools and techniques available to help developers refactor their code. These might include automated refactoring tools that can perform common refactoring tasks automatically, as well as code analysis tools that can help identify areas of the code that need improvement.
